## Overview

This repository contains the source code for a Machine Learning and Deep Learning project aimed at building a classification model capable of identifying the programming language of a given code snippet. The model is trained to classify code snippets into 54 different programming languages.

### Folder Structure

- **data**: Contains scripts for data preprocessing.
- **docker**: Contains configuration files and scripts for building and running Docker environment.
- **classic**: Includes a training pipeline for classic machine learning models implemented using scikit-learn.
- **dl**: Includes a training pipeline for deep learning models implemented using Hydra, PyTorch Lightning, and PyTorch.
